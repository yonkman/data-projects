# data-projects
This repo is home to some of my recent projects involving data collection and transformation. Each project is outlined very briefly here and documented in greater detail within.

## excel
### Neural Network
A regression artificial neural network with mathematical nuts and bolts implemented using standard excel functions.  
### Solar Array Optimization
A tool to determine the optimal positioning of a rooftop solar PV array for a commercial building, and estimate the energy generation and payback period implied by such a project.
### Transient Conduction
Models the temperature profile of a simple one-dimensional rod with heat source at time t. Example of time-dependant finite element analysis implemented in excel. 

## python
### model_csgo
The only work-in-progress in this repo. Designed to predict match outcomes by assigning ratings to professional CounterStrike: Global Offensive players by scraping their performance data from the web using pandas and BeautifulSoup. 
### Neural Network Wine Classification
A short jupyter notebook script using multi-layer perceptrons in scikit-learn to predict the origin of a wine given its 13-feature chemical profile.

## tableau
### GHG Dashboards
A tool for visualizing historic and recent (2014) greenhouse gas emissions by country using various metrics.
