## Excel Neural Network
The goal of this project was to better understand the differential math behind a simple artificial neural network with sigmoid activation function by implementing one from scratch using only standard excel functions. 

**Important note:** both spreadsheets in this folder make heavy use of recursion with excel's iterative calculation feature. This must be enabled by the user by navigating to File-> Options-> Formulas and checking 'iterative calculation'.

### NeuralNet.xlsm
The macro used to generate a new network from input data. A new model can be trained by following the directions on the sheet, or the underlying VBA code can be viewed with alt-F11.

### NNPlots.xlsx
This worksheet was generated by the NeuralNet.xlsm macro. When opened, the file contains a neural network which can be trained by the user to learn the arbitrary function <font face='Courier New'>sqrt(X1) * cos(X2)</font> by iteratively calculating the sheet. As the network is trained, plots on the sheet are updated to represent its output and the deviation of this output from the target (error). The error gradually but slowly approaches zero as the model is trained. 

### NNResults.docx
This word document is simply a collection of plots generated by NNPlots.xlsx, for reference without manually calculating the model. The plots show the gradual reduction in error from the first iteration to i=500,000.
