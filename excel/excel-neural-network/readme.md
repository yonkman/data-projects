### Excel Neural Network
The goal of this project was to better understand the differential math behind a simple artificial neural network by implementing one from scratch using only standard excel functions.

**Important note:** both spreadsheets in this folder make heavy use of recursion with excel's iterative calculation feature. This must be enabled by the user by navigating to File-> Options-> Formulas and checking 'iterative calculation'.
