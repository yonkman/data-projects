## model_csgo
The goal of this project is to assign accurate predictive ratings to professional CounterStrike: Global Offensive players based on their performance at recent events. While the statistical analysis at this stage is preliminary and the assigned ratings are very simple, the script is useful for collecting large quantities of match and player performance data. Also included in this repository are generated data files with ratings and match histories for each player and team attending the currently running IEM Katowice Major tournament.
